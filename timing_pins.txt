Timer0 8-bit   used by wiring.c
Timer1 16-bit  
Timer2 8-bit   used by Tone.cpp
Timer3 16-bit
Timer4 16-bit
Timer5 16-bit

Note that wiring.c writes to registers for all six timers; this means that one should not
assume that ANY of the registers are in their default power-on states. I've been bitten
more than once for not knowing/forgetting this.
